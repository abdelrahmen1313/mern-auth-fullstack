ADD A 2FA VERIFICATION

2FA VERIFICATION IS NOT ENABLED BY DEFAULT

How it works?
  a client send a login request, the request is treated normally,
  then we check if user.2faEnabled
   if false
     send a normal server response

   else 
     check if the current user device (session), is marked as trusted --> FOR THIS WE NEED TO CREATE A DEVICE HASH and provide user.devices hashmap
      if trusted
        proceed normally without sending a 2fa
    
      else
       generate an otp,
       send it to the user by email
       verify-otp validity
